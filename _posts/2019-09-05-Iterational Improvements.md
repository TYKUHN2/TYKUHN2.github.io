I privately messaged a bunch of friends and close colleagues asking for critques and suggestions.

Many of them provided little. The issue with asking people you know is they tend to be too nice.

Some offerred genuine issues to fix such as my link navigation. Some of those issues were pushed today in the commit that included this post.

I am hoping to continue this process of slow trickle of suggestions with a slow trickle of fixes to hopefully, eventually, get a absolutely beautiful website. Who knows? Maybe it will end up migrating away from downloaded Jekyll themes.
