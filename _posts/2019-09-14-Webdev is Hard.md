*This one's a bit of a rant.*

So I made a website. It got lots of compliments. It looks at least okay. So what?

I took a test to prove I know how to make websites. Apparently websites do not count as proof.

I somehow managed to fail the test.

I made a website but could not pass the test proving I can make websites. Why?
A bit of a dissection is required.

1. Some questions were exceedingly confusing.
Poor english combined with bad instructions made it hard to answer.

2. Some questions lacked the correct answers.
I cannot specifically remember what the question and answer was, but it was something along the lines of DNS and what unique thing does a DNS record have.
Fun fact: Nothing about a DNS record is particularly unique.
At best it is a unique record in itself.

3. The coding portions of the questions also included fairly specific and uncommon tags.

Why can I not just submit a damn website?
