## About This Website

This site exists to describe me and my projects, as well as give easier access to those projects. It also hosts some contact information for me.

This website was quickly coded in Jekyll using the Github Hacker theme for Jekyll.
Jekyll actually makes web development far easier than pure HTML development.
It's also surprisingly flexible.

## About Me

I am a programmer of about 9 years as of 2019 with a focus in server applications and frameworks.

I know a ton of languages: C, C++, Java, Javascript (and derivatives like JQuery and NodeJS,) Lua, Python, and a bit of Perl. My primary languages include C++ and Javascript. I have dabbled with things like x86 ASM along the way.

I also have a few years experience with human languages like Spanish and German though I wouldn't consider it particularly reliable.

I often work alone in my projects. I do not do this intentionally. I am looking for voluneteer helpers in many of them.

## Contact

See my contact information on Github for the most up to date information.

I also have a [Matrix server](https://matrix.tyknet.xyz) (I am @tykuhn2:tyknet.xyz)
