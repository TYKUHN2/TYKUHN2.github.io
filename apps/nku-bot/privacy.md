# Privacy Policy (NKU-Bot)

NKU-Bot stores no information of its users.

NKU-Bot receives information from Discord about users and events, either for the purposes of fulfilling its purpose, or extraneously. This information is not stored.

NKU-Bot stores information required to fulfil its purpose between restarts. This includes, but is not limited to, configuration, schemas, and other settings.

NKU-Bot's server may incidentally store information in the routine logging of network access. This information is primarily Discord's own actions, but no guarentee is made.
